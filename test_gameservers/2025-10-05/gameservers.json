Choose from 8 unique classes, each with their own special abilities, and see how long you can survive the madness.\n\nInspired by My Rusty Submarine\nGame is currently in Alpha.\nThis game gets updated almost everyday and bugs are always fixed within a short amount of time. You can report bugs/players or give suggestions using the games feedback system.\nIf this game causes the end of your friendship, it is not my fault, remember, it's just a game.",

Rather than using official or stolen assets, our dev team create custom models, designs, and interpretations based on the TDS universe.\n\nBy playing OTDSRP, you're supporting a small team of dedicated developers who pour hours into making content from scratch.\n\nPlease note: Since everything is built by hand and our team is small, updates may take time. We appreciate your patience and support!\n\nJoin our community server (linked in Social Links) to stay informed about updates, events, and more. (13+)",

    "description": "A game about slapping people into oblivion using different gloves with unique abilities. This game is very chaotic, so don't be surprised if you spot someone complaining about some hand that I'm pretty sure originated from hell itself. You earn slaps when slapping people, which are used to unlock new gloves. Gloves have abilities, some are passive, others are activated by pressing \"E\" (mobile players have a button). Shift lock is recommended. ANY FORM OF EXPLOITING WILL RESULT IN A PERMANENT BAN\n- don't risk it 😡😡😡😡😡😡 Credit to DM DOKU, Desolo Zantas and Tim Haywood for creating several songs used.",

But today, SHADOWED worlds have begun to shift the balance... and the Earth might be at it's edge.\n\nThis game has Undertale/Deltarune inspired turn-based RPG battle system, with it's own story, music, sprites and 3D overworld!\n\nThe game was inspired by Undertale/Deltarune a lot, and these games were made by Toby Fox, so go support him!\n\nWe highly recommend playing UNDERTALE or DELTARUNE before this game to better understand the battle mechanics.\n\nYou can count this game as a sequel to Delta Warriors.\n\nCredits are in SETTINGS (in-experience)",

Can you outlast the madness… or will you join it?\n\n🔹 Infected – Begin as a survivor, but one step in the wrong puddle and you're infected for good.

    "description": "[THIS GAME IS STILL IN BETA, EXPECT BUGS AND GLITCHES]\n\nA player at random is chosen to be either a Survivor or a Driver. The Drivers has to run over all the deer shaped speed bumps, while the Survivors have to use their different abilities to survive. Earn more Cash the longer you survive. You can use your cash to buy new drivers and survivors. \n\nWhile the \"Hitbox\" issue was lessened, there might still be a slight issue. The \"Hitbox\" issue due to Roblox's de-sync, meaning as of right now there is no fix. De-sync is basically a delay between user actions, meaning if one thing happens on your screen, it takes 1-2 seconds for it to happen on someone else's screen. \n---------------------------------------------------\n\nControls: Shift to Sprint | Q to use Ability\nMobile: On-Screen buttons\nConsole: Coming soon..\n\nHeavily inspired by Deltarune and Undertale. \nCharacters, music, and sprites are from Deltarune and Undertale. \n\nBERGENTRUCK",

Overfishing through trawlers both legally and illegally is depleting our marine life as well as destroying coral reefs. Whales and dolphins are being hunted in horrible ways as well as being used for entertainment by inhumane marine parks. Many pesticides and nutrients used in agriculture end up in the coastal waters, resulting in oxygen depletion that kills marine plants and shellfish. Factories and industrial plants discharge sewage and other runoff into the oceans.",
